# Summary
This project was developed in Angular, with usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Api</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding">Google Maps Geocoding API</a> to grab locations by address and converting them to geographic coordinates for the weather APi to process. 
# Further Improvements
Ideas include:
- [ ] Autocompletion of geocaching address. To show relevant locations as you are typing (like most modern apps include nowadays)
- [ ] More UI Panels to display categorized weather information (Current, Minutely, Hourly, Daily, Weekly, etc.)
  - [ ] Selecting between said panels in the app.
- [ ] In-app reduction of api request calls to prevent overusage of data requests. (I dont believe weather data changes all that much in a span of seconds)
