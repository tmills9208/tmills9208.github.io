# Summary
A full gaming/social-media, full-stack, web application we proposed and developed for our final cumulative project of our College program. I was mostly in charge of the front-end development, with my two colleagues performing as a back-end developer, and a project manager respectively. The project had won 2nd place for being intuitive and functionally stable, along with a good marketing proposal.
I was responsible for most of the front-end development. Making the site pages, core functions, API calling from and to the backend
